# ScoreKeeper

## About

I had built this application in a few days using only vanilla javascript. The purpose is to keep track of your overall score during a round of disc golf. I have never been a fan of keeping a scorecard with each hole present so I built this as a way to keep score without having to concern myself with what I specifically got on each hole.

## Who is this for?

I had created this just for myself, however it's meant for those who want to keep a running tally throughoput their round. It can be used at any course accross the world as the skore keeping is not defined by any set number of holes, or the set par per hole.

## How to use it

When playing disc golf, the scoring of each hole is determined by the set par for that hole. Depending on what you shoot on that hole, you either add or subtract points from your overall score.

For Example:
* Eagle = -2
* Birdie = -1
* Par = 0
* Bogey = +1
* Double-Bogey = +2
And so on. 

At the end of the round you can then take your overall score and subtract the overall par for the course. So if your tally ends up being 72, witht he overall par being 60 you would end up with an ending score of +12.

## Future Advancements

Currently scores are only saved to local storage so that if you leave the page you do not lose your count for that round, however I am working on functionality to to save your scores to a databse enabling you to look at your past records, as well as being able to save the names of the players active in a round. I am also working towards an automatic scoring system in which you would be able to enter the overall par on the course and at the end of the round it will give you your scored based upon the overall par of the course you are playing.
