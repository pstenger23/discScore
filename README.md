# ScoreKeeper

## About

I have been playing disc golf regularly for a couple of years now and I have never been too good at keeping/remembering what I was shooting on the round. The purpose is to keep track of your score during a round of disc golf. I have found that keeping score in disc golf is a little more difficult as at most courses you are not provided with a score card, so I made a site that acts as such. It works for any course, and any amount of holes, as the tally can be infinite.

## Who is this for?

I had created this just for myself, however it's meant for those who want to keep a physical score of their round. It can be used at any course accross the world as the score keeping is not defined by any set number of holes, or the set par per hole.

## How to use it

When playing disc golf, the scoring of each hole is determined by the set par for that hole. Depending on what you shoot on that hole, you either add or subtract points from your score using the '+' and '-' buttons.

For Example:
* Eagle = -2
* Birdie = -1
* Par = 0
* Bogey = +1
* Double-Bogey = +2
And so on. 

At the completion of the hole, you would tally your score (based on par) and hit the 'add score' button which will record what you shot. The scores are listed on a numbered list which can act as the hole number, and the score for that hole. At the end of the round you can add your scores on each hole together and fine out what you shot on the course. When your ready to play again you just need to hit the 'New Game' button to reset all of the tallies.

## Technologies Used

This application was built using HTML5, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. Saving the score of each hole into local storage so that the user does not lose their round if the page is closed, or refreshed. A 'New Game' button was added which will clear local storage and reset the round for the next one.

## Future Advancements

Currently the applicatiion gives you an easy way to keep track of what you shot on each hole, however at the end of the round it is up to the user to add the scores in order to find the total score for the round. In future developments I hope to add functionality to automatically add teh scores together and provide you with the score that you had finished with. I will also be working on getting the site optimized for all mobile devices as many people do not play disc golf with their computer handy.
